So far, a large number of the city\\u0019s villages and districts have been purged of terrorists. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has vowed that the country\\u0019s second largest city will be fully recaptured by year-end.

Flynn as national security adviser caps a remarkably tumultuous first month for President Trump\\u0019s White House that has burdened the early days of his presidency with scandal, legal challenges, personnel drama and questions about his temperament during interactions with world leaders. Mr. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, lasted only 24 days before his tenure was cut short by an admission that he had misled the vice president and other White House colleagues about the contents of a phone call with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The resignation on Monday night and the continuing turmoil inside the National Security Council have deeply rattled the Washington establishment. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, railed against the administration on Tuesday, decrying the \\u001cdysfunction\\u001d of the country\\u0019s national security apparatus and accusing the White House of being a place where \\u001cnobody knows who\\u0019s in charge and nobody knows who\\u0019s setting policy. \\u001d Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military\\u0019s Special Operations Command, expressed concern about upheaval inside the White House. \\u001cOur government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon because we\\u0019re a nation at war,\\u001d he said at a military conference on Tuesday. Asked about his comments later, General Thomas said in a brief interview, \\u001cAs a commander, I\\u0019m concerned our government be as stable as possible. \\u001d But Mr. Flynn\\u0019s   departure just added to the broader sense of chaos at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In record time, the 45th president has set off global outrage with a ban on travelers from   countries, fired his acting attorney general for refusing to defend the ban and watched as federal courts swiftly moved to block the policy, calling it an unconstitutional use of executive power. The president angrily provoked the cancellation of a summit meeting with the Mexican president, hung up on Australia\\u0019s prime minister, authorized a commando raid that resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL member, repeatedly lied about the existence of millions of fraudulent votes cast in the 2016 election and engaged in Twitter wars with senators, a sports team owner, a Hollywood actor and a major department store chain. His words and actions have generated almost daily protests around the country. \\u001cI\\u0019ve never been so nervous in my lifetime about what may or may not happen in Washington,\\u001d said Leon Panetta, a Democrat who served as chief of staff, secretary of defense and C. I. A. director during a   career that spanned nine presidents from both parties. \\u001cI don\\u0019t know whether this White House is capable of responding in a thoughtful or careful way should a crisis erupt,\\u001d he said in an interview on Tuesday. \\u001cYou can do    stuff over a period of time. But at some point, I don\\u0019t give a damn what your particular sense of change is all about, you cannot afford to have change become chaos. \\u001d Mr. Trump\\u0019s allies note that the president has moved forward in areas that are more typical of the early days of a   administration. Mr. Trump nominated a Supreme Court justice 12 days into his tenure, and has issued a dozen executive orders, including ones to limit the influence of lobbyists, reduce regulations, pare the Affordable Care Act, move forward on pipeline construction, end trade deals and speed up deportations. Those accomplishments are catnip for the president\\u0019s most fervent supporters across the country, said Sara Fagen, who served as a senior aide and political director for former President George W. Bush. The perspective on the White House is very different far outside the interstate freeway that rings Washington, she said.\\u0019 \\u001d\\u001cIf you\\u0019re someone inside the Beltway, you think it\\u0019s been really rocky,\\u001d she said. \\u001cIf you are outside the Beltway, you think, \\u0018That\\u0019s why we sent him there.\\u0019 There has been a lot of chaos and a lot of growing pains, but they have gotten a lot done. \\u001d\\u001d \\u0019Still, half of the president\\u0019s cabinet has yet to be confirmed by the   Senate, and several other key White House aides have become lightning rods for daily mockery by   comedians. It all has official Washington reeling and exhausted as it tries to make sense of  \\u0014   and keep up with  \\u0014   the nearly constant tornado of activity swirling around the president and his advisers. \\u001cIf you had   Obama, you\\u0019ve got      Trump,\\u001d said John Feehery, a veteran Republican strategist, who compared the last several weeks to the chaotic start to Newt Gingrich\\u0019s tenure as speaker of the House in 1995. \\u001cNewt never settled down. It was always one crisis after another,\\u001d Mr. Feehery recalled. \\u001cThis might be the new normal. People will start getting used to the new normal, but will also be exhausted by it. \\u001d As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised to move quickly to stop illegal immigration, bring jobs back, end trade deals and reduce crime. Central to his campaign agenda was his pledge to be a disruptive force in Washington  \\u0014   and he has certainly done that. Since winning the election, Mr. Trump and his closest aides have embraced the turmoil, viewing it as evidence of their aggressive efforts to fundamentally reorient the government. The West Wing also uses the chaos as a tactical weapon, believing that the flurry of   presidential tweets, controversial statements during the afternoon briefing and surprise executive actions work to keep their adversaries, the media and others off balance. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, happily kept reporters waiting while he did \\u001ca quick recap of the president\\u0019s activity,\\u001d proceeding to offer a long list of meetings and phone calls with foreign leaders, female entrepreneurs, local officials and educators. Yet the disruptions have come at a cost: the president has so far made little progress on legislation that would repeal President Barack Obama\\u0019s signature health care law. The White House has not proposed a promised infrastructure bill to repair deteriorating roads, bridges and tunnels. And the president\\u0019s aides have not yet drawn up plans for an overhaul of the nation\\u0019s tax code. \\u001cIt\\u0019s pretty predictable,\\u001d Mr. Feehery said. \\u001cThis guy has never been in government before and he promised to be disruptive. \\u001d It may also have consequences for Mr. Trump\\u0019s ability to help Republicans win in the 2018 midterm elections. And Republican campaign experts acknowledge that his chances for winning   may hinge on his ability to contain the White House frenzy. \\u001cYou are processing so much information in a day now. This stuff would have doomed anyone else, just one or two of them,\\u001d said Thomas M. Davis, a former Republican member of Congress from Virginia. \\u001cThey have got to produce something. If all you\\u0019ve got is a bunch of executive orders and a Twitter feed, you don\\u0019t want to go into an election like that. \\u001d Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney during both of his presidential campaigns, said Mr. Trump\\u0019s voters in 2016 wanted him to overhaul an establishment in Washington, which they view as long on promises, long on process but short on action. \\u001cVoters certainly asked for change. They certainly wanted to see disruption,\\u001d Mr. Madden said. \\u001cBut if change begins to look like confusion and disruption morphs into disorder, you risk losing a certain level of confidence with voters. \\u001d\",\n          \"MINNEAPOLIS  \\u0014   On April 21, as news spread that Prince had been found dead at his Paisley Park compound in Chanhassen, Minn. a crowd began to gather 21 miles away at First Avenue, the Minneapolis club where he had filmed the concert scenes for the 1984 film \\u001cPurple Rain. \\u001d Thousands of fans flocked to what became a giant   block party memorial, and local acts took the stage to play covers of Prince\\u0019s songs. On Thursday night, Prince\\u0019s band the Revolution arrived on that stage for the first time since 2012 to honor, and grieve for, one of their own. For three months after his death, the group had remained silent about details of a reunion, finally confirming a   stand (which grew to include a third) in early July. \\u001cI need this as much as you,\\u001d the bassist Mark Brown, a. k. a. Brownmark, wrote on Facebook at the time of the announcement. \\u001cSharing the music with you is what will heal. \\u001d Thursday night\\u0019s show, the first of the brief run, offered the crowd of 1, 500 the chance to experience Prince\\u0019s music as performed by the musicians who helped define it: Wendy Melvoin (guitar) Lisa Coleman and Matt Fink (who\\u0019s called Dr. on keyboards) Mr. Brown (bass) and Bobby Rivkin, known as Bobby Z (drums) as well as the   Andr\\u00c8 Cymone and the lead guitarist Dez Dickerson, who had played with Prince in the years before the Revolution. The group had previously reunited at First Avenue for a benefit for Mr. Rivkin after he had a heart attack in 2012, and according to Nathan Kranz, the club\\u0019s general manager, Mr. Rivkin did most of the legwork in staging the current reunions. Mr. Dickerson said there was talk of getting back together at the Los Angeles memorial for Prince in May: \\u001cThings were being sorted. \\u001d The shows were finally booked in  . \\u001cLook at those smiling faces! That\\u0019s what we want to see,\\u001d Ms. Melvoin said from the stage on Thursday night, perhaps trying to nudge the mood toward celebration from something more somber, before the band surged into its opening song, \\u001cLet\\u0019s Go Crazy. \\u001d She added, \\u001cI expect to hear everyone singing. \\u001d She got her wish, on and off the stage. With no Prince anchoring the band, group vocals  \\u0014   harmonies,      \\u0014   were plentiful, and Ms. Melvoin stepped up front for rockers like \\u001cLet\\u0019s Go Crazy\\u001d and \\u001cRaspberry Beret. \\u001d With Mr. Cymone and Mr. Dickerson joining the band, they recreated \\u001c1999,\\u001d alternating singers on each opening line. Mr. Cymone took lead on \\u001cLittle Red Corvette,\\u001d and a quick survey of the club showed that most everyone in it was singing along ditto, later, for \\u001cKiss,\\u001d which the Revolution played in a way that was close to the original recording, unlike their boss, who had constantly changed the arrangement. A number of guests bolstered the show. The RB singer Bilal was a welcome surprise, having not only aced the BET Awards\\u0019 Prince tribute but also one at Carnegie Hall in 2013. At First Avenue, he proved a mellifluous falsetto for hire, especially on \\u001cThe Beautiful Ones,\\u001d whose climax he lifted with his nimble squall. Fans spied other familiar faces onstage: Susannah Melvoin (Wendy\\u0019s sister, Prince\\u0019s former girlfriend and the lead singer in the Family, a band he masterminded) Omar Baker, Prince\\u0019s brother (resplendent in a white fedora and   shoes) the \\u001cPurple Rain\\u001d   Apollonia (who introduced the encore by tossing gold hoop earrings to the crowd, a motif in the movie) and Prince\\u0019s   Mayte Garcia. The crowd members were largely in their 40s and 50s, many from out of town. One of the first in was Scott Bogen, a Twin Cities native who once won $1, 000 impersonating Prince for First Avenue\\u0019s     contest. He has lived for the last two decades in Big Sur, where he is a volunteer firefighter, and came back here for the reunion. \\u001cWe\\u0019ve been fighting the fire for five weeks straight,\\u001d he said, referring to the West Coast wildfires. \\u001cMy property burned, but my house survived. \\u001d Mr. Bogen said it was fortunate that the fire didn\\u0019t claim the tambourine Prince signed for him in 1981. There were mementos available at the Revolution\\u0019s merchandise table  \\u0014   four   two hoodies  \\u0014   where a line of a dozen that had assembled by 7:13 p. m. had tripled by 7:20. (The club\\u0019s doors had opened at 7.) But many in the audience were wearing two   that weren\\u0019t for sale: designs featuring a list of the Revolution members\\u0019 names or the contents of a lunchbox in \\u001cStarfish  Coffee,\\u001d a song on Prince\\u0019s 1987 double album, \\u001cSign o\\u0019 the Times. \\u001d It\\u0019s hard to imagine the Revolution tribute\\u0019s taking place anywhere other than First Avenue. Prince had used the club as a home performance base since 1981, and it was the spot where he debuted the song \\u001cPurple Rain\\u001d in 1983, before it made many memorable appearances in the film the following year. A replica of the motorcycle from the movie stood where pinball machines once did. A few fans wore   of Prince\\u0019s \\u001cPurple Rain\\u001d trench    look. Much of Ms. Melvoin\\u0019s stage patter revolved around the idea of the show\\u0019s being not just in Prince\\u0019s memory, but for his heavenly delectation. After a cheer following \\u001cAmerica,\\u001d she focused on the crowd. \\u001cEverybody hear that?\\u001d she asked. \\u001cLet\\u0019s help him hear this. \\u001d When Ms. Melvoin and Ms. Coleman played \\u001cSometimes It Snows in April\\u001d as a duo, quiet and acoustic, Ms. Melvoin struggled to keep her composure it was a clear highlight, particularly when she sang, \\u001cAlways cry for love, never cry for pain,\\u001d to some deeply felt shouts from the crowd. At the end of the night, one thing stood out  \\u0014   that the band didn\\u0019t even try to copy Prince\\u0019s singular guitar solos, in particular for \\u001cLet\\u0019s Go Crazy\\u001d and \\u001cPurple Rain,\\u001d the inevitable show closer. The lack of flash for \\u001cPurple Rain\\u001d wasn\\u0019t total (there were actual lighters in the air) but it nevertheless gave the song a rawer charge than usual. It was stark, yet fitting. Who could ever replace their man?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 194,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \" 5A;8 1K 70 :C;8A0<8 =5 2KOA=8;>AL =5GB> A>2A5< =5>6840==>5. \",\n          \" has withdrawn his endorsement of Hillary Clinton for the presidency following the renewal of the FBI investigation into Clinton and her her top aide Huma Abedin.

It\\u0019s not just whitewater, it\\u0019s several investigations where documents have turned up missing, exonerating the Clintons and clearing them of guilt, despite huge violations of obstruction of justice.\\nHISTORY OF LOSING DOCUMENTS DURING INVESTIGATIONS: \\nIn 1999, investigators looked into then First Lady Hillary and President Bill Clinton\\u0019s scandals, which included Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and other scandals. It was discovered that more than 1 million subpoenaed emails were mysteriously \\u001clost\\u001d due to a \\u001cglitch\\u001d in a West Wing computer server . \\nDuring the Project X email scandal, career White House staffers and contractors found that someone close to the first lady had basically turned off the White House\\u0019s automated email archiving system. \\nWHITEWATER: \\nThe first notable case is the whitewater land scandal fiasco, which started in Arkansas when Bill Clinton was governor. The allegation is that the Clintons used the Rose Law Firm and the Arkansas Financial Department Authority, as well as Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan owned by Susan and Jim McDougal , to scam Arkansas residents. An investigation was started when the Clintons invested and lost money in the Whitewater Development Corporation.\\nAn entire article could be dedicated to the Whitewater scandal, but what is important here is that documents for the whitewater investigation turned up missing were later discovered at the Clintons\\u0019 home .\\nBen Shapiro of Breitbart noted in his own article on Hillary\\u0019s long history of hiding documents :\\nIn 1996, a special Senate Whitewater committee released a report from the FBI demonstrating that documents sought in the Whitewater investigation had been found in the personal Clinton quarters of the White House. The First Lady\\u0019s fingerprints were on them. The documents had gone mysteriously missing for two years. \\nMark Fabiani, special White House counsel, immediately stated that there was no problem, according to the Times: \\u001cHe added that she had testified under oath that she had nothing to do with the documents during the two years they were missing and did not know how they ended up in the family quarters.\\u001d Hillary remains the only First Lady in American history to be fingerprinted by the FBI. Those weren\\u0019t the only missing Whitewater documents later found in the Clinton White House. \\nVINCE FOSTER: \\nThe next notable case, which is also connected to Whitewater is Vince Foster. Foster worked alongside the Clintons as a top Rose Law firm attorney who had worked intimately with then First Lady Hillary Clinton throughout their career together. After Foster\\u0019s \\u001csuicide,\\u001d documents went missing from his office . Secret Service officer Henry O\\u0019Neill testified that he witnessed aides removing documents.\\nSeveral years later, more documents pertaining to Hillary Clinton and Vince Foster again vanished, this time from the National Library including a document from Ken Star\\u0019s investigation that proves that the \\u001csuicide\\u001d of Vince Foster was actually a murder . In those documents is the smoking gun that shows that Vince Foster sustained not one but two bullet wounds. One to the neck and one to the head an impossible suicide scenario.\\nIn addition to that, experts have called Foster\\u0019s suicide note \\u001ca forgery.\\u001d One of my rules is once, twice, okay, but three times is not a coincidence\\u0014it\\u0019s a criminal conspiracy. Conspiracy, as in the legal definition not a theory none of this is a theory when it\\u0019s well sourced.\\nTRAVEL GATE: \\nIn 1996, the day before the Whitewater documents were found at the White House, a two-year-old memo emerged written by a former Presidential aide. According to the New York Times it proved that Hillary Clinton \\u001chad played a far greater role in the dismissal of employees of the White House travel office than the Administration has acknowledged.\\u001d \\nPROJECT X EMAIL GATE: \\nAccording to Tom Fitton, President of Judicial Watch, Hillary\\u0019s top lawyer and top aide, Cheryl Mills \\u001chelped orchestrate the cover-up of another major scandal, often referred to as \\u0018Project X Email-gate.\\u0019\\u001d Over the course of years, the Clinton Administration allegedly withheld 1.8 million email communications from Judicial Watch\\u0019s attorneys, as well as federal investigators and Congress. In addition, Judicial Watch says that when a White House computer contractor attempted to reveal the emails, White House officials \\u001cinstructed her to keep her mouth shut about the hidden e-mail or face dismissal and jail time.\\u001d \\n2015-2016 EMAIL GATE: \\nWhere do I start about the botched investigation of Hillary\\u0019s private email server? The obstruction of justice is so broad, it\\u0019s insane. She used \\u001cbleach bit\\u001d software the day after being subpoenaed, smashed several BlackBerrys and iPads with hammers, was tipped off by the DoJ and DoS into the investigation, according to Wikileaks, etc.\\nClinton\\u0019s close ally Terry McAulife gave a donation to the wife of the Deputy Director Of The FBI.

In the most startling shift, the White House issued an unexpected statement appealing to the Israeli government not to expand the construction of Jewish settlements beyond their current borders in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Such expansion, it said, \\u001cmay not be helpful in achieving\\u001d the goal of peace. At the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki R. Haley declared that the United States would not lift sanctions against Russia until it stopped destabilizing Ukraine and pulled troops out of Crimea. On Iran, the administration is preparing economic sanctions similar to those the Obama administration imposed just over a year ago. The White House has also shown no indication that it plans to rip up Mr. Obama\\u0019s landmark nuclear deal, despite Mr. Trump\\u0019s withering criticism of it during the presidential campaign. New administrations often fail to change the foreign policies of their predecessors as radically as they promised, in large part because statecraft is so different from campaigning. And of course, today\\u0019s positions could shift over time. There is no doubt the Trump administration has staked out new ground on trade and immigration, upending relations with Mexico and large parts of the Muslim world in the process. But the administration\\u0019s reversals were particularly stark because they came after days of tempestuous phone calls between Mr. Trump and foreign leaders, in which he gleefully challenged diplomatic orthodoxy and appeared to jeopardize one relationship after another. Mr. Trump made warmer relations with Russia the centerpiece of his foreign policy during the campaign, and European leaders had been steeling for him to lift sanctions they and Mr. Obama imposed on President Vladimir V. Putin after he annexed Crimea. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump\\u0019s United Nations ambassador, Ms. Haley, sounded a lot like her predecessor, Samantha Power. \\u001cWe do want to better our relations with Russia,\\u001d she said in her first remarks to an open session of the United Nations Security Council. \\u001cHowever, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions. \\u001d Similarly, Mr. Trump presented himself during the campaign as a stalwart supporter of Israel and criticized the Obama administration for allowing the passage of a Security Council resolution in December that condemned Israel for its expansion of settlements. \\u001cWhile we don\\u0019t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace,\\u001d his press secretary, Sean Spicer, said in a statement, \\u001cthe construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal. \\u001d The White House noted that the president \\u001chas not taken an official position on settlement activity. \\u001d It said he would discuss the issue with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel when they meet Feb. 15, in effect telling Mr. Netanyahu to wait until then. Emboldened by Mr. Trump\\u0019s support, Israel has announced more than 5, 000 new homes in the West Bank since his inauguration. Mr. Trump shifted his policy after he met briefly with King Abdullah II of Jordan on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast  \\u0014   an encounter that put the king, one of the most respected leaders of the Arab world, ahead of Mr. Netanyahu in seeing the new president. Jordan, with its large Palestinian population, has been steadfastly critical of settlements. The administration\\u0019s abrupt turnaround also coincided with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\\u0019s first day at the State Department and the arrival of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in South Korea on his first official trip. Both men are viewed as potentially capable of exerting a moderating influence on the president and his cadre of White House advisers, though it was unclear how much they had to do with the shifts. With Iran, Mr. Trump has indisputably taken a harder line than his predecessor. While the Obama administration often looked for ways to avoid confrontation with Iran in its last year, Mr. Trump seems equally eager to challenge what he has said is an Iranian expansion across the region, especially in Iraq and Yemen. In an early morning Twitter post on Thursday, Mr. Trump was bombastic on Iran. \\u001cIran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile,\\u001d he wrote. \\u001cShould have been thankful for the terrible deal the U. S. made with them!\\u001d In a second post, he said wrongly, \\u001cIran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U. S. came along and gave it a   in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion. \\u001d Still, the administration has been careful not to specify what the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, meant when he said on Wednesday that Iran had been put \\u001con notice\\u001d for its missile test and for its arming and training of the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The new sanctions could be announced as soon as Friday. But most experts have said they will have little practical effect, because the companies that supply missile parts rarely have direct business with the United States, and allies have usually been reluctant to reimpose sanctions after many were lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear accord. Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Iran\\u0019s supreme leader, replied, \\u001cThis is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran,\\u001d according to the semiofficial Fars news agency. \\u001cThe American government will understand that threatening Iran is useless. \\u001d Some analysts said they worried that the administration did not have tools, short of military action, to back up its warning. \\u001cWhether the Trump administration intended it or not, they have created their own red line,\\u001d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \\u001cWhen Iran tests again, the administration will have no choice but to put up or shut up. \\u001d Mr. Netanyahu will cheer Mr. Trump\\u0019s tough tone with Iran. But the statement on settlements may force him to change course on a delicate domestic issue. His coalition government seemed to take Mr. Trump\\u0019s inauguration as a starting gun in a race to increase construction in occupied territory. After Mr. Trump was sworn in, Israel announced that it would authorize another 2, 500 homes in areas already settled in the West Bank, and then followed that this week by announcing 3, 000 more. On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu took it a step further, vowing to build the first new settlement in the West Bank in many years. For Mr. Netanyahu, the settlement spree reflects a sense of liberation after years of constraints from Washington, especially under Mr. Obama, who, like other presidents, viewed settlement construction as an impediment to negotiating a final peace settlement. It is also an effort to deflect criticism from Israel\\u0019s political right for Mr. Netanyahu\\u0019s compliance with a court order to force several dozen families out of an illegal West Bank outpost, Amona. The \\u001cbeyond their current borders\\u001d phrase in the White House statement hinted at a return to a policy President George W. Bush outlined to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004, which acknowledged that it was unrealistic to expect Israel to give up its major settlements in a final deal, although they would be offset by mutually   land swaps. Mr. Trump had also promised to move the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But the White House has slowed down the move, in part out of fear of a violent response. The policy shifts came after a turbulent week in which Mr. Trump also clashed with the leaders of Australia and Mexico over one of the most fraught issues of his new presidency: immigration. He defended the tense exchanges as an overdue display of toughness by a United States that has been exploited \\u001cby every nation in the world, virtually. \\u001d \\u001cThey\\u0019re tough we have to be tough. It\\u0019s time we\\u0019re going to be a little tough, folks,\\u001d he said at the prayer breakfast Thursday. \\u001cIt\\u0019s not going to happen anymore. \\u001d Yet later in the day, the White House felt obliged to put a more diplomatic gloss on events. Mr. Spicer said Mr. Trump\\u0019s call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia had been \\u001cvery cordial,\\u001d even if Mr. Trump bitterly opposed an agreement negotiated by the Obama administration for the United States to accept the transfer of 1, 250 refugees from an Australian detention camp. A senior administration official disputed a report that Mr. Trump had threatened to send troops to Mexico to deal with its \\u001cbad hombres. \\u001d The official said that the conversation with President Enrique Pe\\u00d2a Nieto had been \\u001cactually very friendly,\\u001d and that Mr. Trump had been speaking in jest.\",\n          \"Basma Abdel Aziz was walking in downtown Cairo one morning when she saw a long line of people standing in front of a closed government building. Returning hours later, Ms. Abdel Aziz, a psychiatrist who counsels torture victims, passed the same people still waiting listlessly  \\u0014   a young woman and an elderly man, a mother holding her baby. The building remained closed. When she got home, she immediately started writing about the people in line and didn\\u0019t stop for 11 hours. The story became her surreal debut novel, \\u001cThe Queue,\\u001d which takes place after a failed revolution in an unnamed Middle Eastern city. The narrative unfolds over 140 days, as civilians are forced to wait in an endless line to petition a shadowy authority called The Gate for basic services. \\u001cFiction gave me a very wide space to say what I wanted to say about totalitarian authority,\\u001d Ms. Abdel Aziz said in a recent interview. \\u001cThe Queue,\\u001d which was just published in English by Melville House, has drawn comparisons to Western classics like George Orwell\\u0019s \\u001c1984\\u001d and \\u001cThe Trial\\u001d by Franz Kafka. It represents a new wave of dystopian and surrealist fiction from Middle Eastern writers who are grappling with the chaotic aftermath and stinging disappointments of the Arab Spring. Five years after the popular uprisings in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and elsewhere, a bleak, apocalyptic strain of   literature has taken root in the region. Some writers are using science fiction and fantasy tropes to describe grim current political realities. Others are writing about controversial subjects like sexuality and atheism, or exhuming painful historical episodes that were previously off limits. In a literary culture where poetry has long been the most celebrated medium, writers are experimenting with a range of genres and styles, including comics and graphic novels, hallucinatory horror novels and allegorical works of science fiction. \\u001cThere\\u0019s a shift away from realism, which has dominated Arabic literature,\\u001d said the   novelist Saleem Haddad, whose new book, \\u001cGuapa,\\u001d is narrated by a young gay Arab man whose friend has been imprisoned after a political revolt. \\u001cWhat\\u0019s coming to the surface now is darker and a bit deeper. \\u001d Science fiction and surrealism have long provided an escape valve for writers living under oppressive regimes. In Latin America, decades of fascism and civil war helped inspire masterpieces of magical realism from authors like Gabriel Garc\\u00cca M\\u00b7rquez and Isabel Allende. In Russia, the postmodern novelist Vladimir Sorokin has published disturbing and controversial futuristic novels that surreptitiously skewer the country\\u0019s repressive government. Dystopian themes are not entirely new in Arabic fiction. But they have become much more prominent in recent years, publishers and translators say. The genre has proliferated in part because it captures the sense of despair that many writers say they feel in the face of cyclical violence and repression. At the same time, futuristic settings may give writers some measure of cover to explore charged political ideas without being labeled dissidents. \\u001cThese futuristic stories are all about lost utopia,\\u001d said Layla     of a collection of   Spring writing titled \\u001cDiaries of an Unfinished Revolution. \\u001d \\u001cPeople really could imagine a better future, and now it\\u0019s almost worse than it was before. \\u001d In the turbulent months after the uprisings, when the promises of democracy and greater social freedom remained elusive, some novelists channeled their frustrations and fears into grim apocalyptic tales. In Mohammed Rabie\\u0019s gritty novel \\u001cOtared,\\u001d which will be published in English this year by the American University in Cairo, a former Egyptian police officer joins a fight against a mysterious occupying power that rules the country in 2025. Mr. Rabie said he wrote the novel in response to the \\u001csuccessive defeats\\u001d that advocates of democracy faced after the 2011 demonstrations that ended President Hosni Mubarak\\u0019s   rule. While there are parallels to   Egyptian society, setting the story in the near future allowed him to write more freely, without drawing explicit connections to Egypt\\u0019s current ruler, he said in an email interview translated by his Arabic publisher. Nael Eltoukhy, whose darkly satirical 2013 novel, \\u001cWomen of Karantina,\\u001d takes place partly in a   Alexandria in the year 2064, said he felt that a futuristic farce was the best way to reflect the jaded mood in Egypt. \\u001cIn Egypt, especially after the revolution, everything is terrible, but everything is also funny,\\u001d he said in an interview. \\u001cNow, I think it\\u0019s worse than the time of Mubarak. \\u001d Gloomy futuristic stories have proved popular with readers, and several of these novels have been critical and commercial hits. \\u001cOtared\\u001d was a finalist for this year\\u0019s prestigious International Prize for Arabic Fiction. Publishers say the books have caught on with the public in part because they distill a collective feeling of frustration. This new body of   literature shows a sharp tonal shift from the ecstatic outpouring that arrived immediately after the Arab Spring, when many writers published breathless memoirs or dug out old manuscripts they had stashed away for years. Celebrated Egyptian novelists like Ahdaf Soueif and Mona Prince wrote firsthand nonfiction accounts of the 2011 protests in Tahrir Square. The Syrian novelist Samar Yazbek published diaries she kept during the Syrian uprising. A new generation of writers drew inspiration from the stunning scenes of citizens rising up together against entrenched dictatorships. \\u001cThere was something about the experience of the revolution where suddenly you had a voice, and your voice had weight and it had meaning,\\u001d said Yasmine El Rashidi, an Egyptian journalist whose first novel, \\u001cChronicle of a Last Summer,\\u001d about a young woman\\u0019s political awakening in Cairo during and after Mr. Mubarak\\u0019s rule, will be published in the United States next month. In the years since the revolution, that optimism has withered, and the authorities have cracked down on creative expression across the region. In Saudi Arabia, the poet Ashraf Fayadh was sentenced to death last year for his verses, which religious authorities called blasphemous. After an international outcry, his sentence was reduced to eight years in prison and 800 lashes. In Egypt, under the strict rule of President Abdel Fattah   the government has shut art galleries, raided publishing houses and confiscated copies of books it views as controversial. Last year, customs officers seized 400 copies of \\u001cWalls of Freedom,\\u001d about Egyptian political street art, and charged that the book was \\u001cinstigating revolt. \\u001d \\u001cWe are concerned now with what we publish,\\u001d said   Rizk, director of Dar   Egypt, an Arabic publishing house. \\u001cIf something is banned, it does create commercial problems. \\u001d Despite explicit protections for free speech in Egypt\\u0019s 2014 Constitution, the authorities have targeted individual writers and artists. The novelist Ahmed Naji is serving a   prison sentence for violating \\u001cpublic modesty\\u001d with sexually explicit passages in his experimental novel \\u001cThe Use of Life. \\u001d Many fear that his imprisonment will lead to more  . \\u001cThe Arab Spring and the revolution broke people\\u0019s fears and gave them the initiative to express themselves,\\u001d said Ms. Abdel Aziz, whose novel, \\u001cThe Queue,\\u001d was published in Arabic in 2013. \\u001cNow we are back to oppression. \\u001d Ms. Abdel Aziz, 39, earned a master\\u0019s degree in neuropsychiatry in 2005 and now works part time at a center in Cairo that counsels victims of torture and violence. She has published two   collections and several nonfiction books on sensitive subjects like torture and the human rights violations committed by Egyptian security forces. But after Mr. Mubarak\\u0019s fall, writing a factual account felt like an inadequate way to capture the surreal experience of ordinary Egyptians who lived through the uprisings and subsequent crackdowns, she said. Instead, she aimed to write a universal story that reflected what was unfolding around her but transcended geography and current events. She started writing \\u001cThe Queue\\u001d in September 2012. The novel follows a young salesman, Yehya, who was shot during a failed uprising. Yehya is denied medical treatment and forced to wait in an endless line to petition The Gate for a permit to have surgery. As he grows weaker, the line only gets longer, stretching on for miles. Ms. Abdel Aziz uses coded language for loaded political terms and events throughout the novel, which was translated by Elisabeth Jaquette. The 2011 uprising against Mr. Mubarak is called \\u001cthe First Storm. \\u001d A later civilian revolt that ended in bloodshed is referred to as \\u001cthe Disgraceful Events. \\u001d Ms. Abdel Aziz worries about the growing scrutiny Egyptian writers and activists face. About a dozen of her friends are in prison, she said. She has been arrested three times for taking part in demonstrations and protests. But she feels that living in fear is futile. \\u001cI\\u0019m not afraid anymore,\\u001d she said. \\u001cI will not stop writing. \\u001d\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
